# hyperdb

Distributed scalable database.

```
npm install hyperdb
```

Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for details on how hyperdb works.

## Usage

``` js
var hyperdb = require('hyperdb')

var db = hyperdb('./my.db', {valueEncoding: 'utf-8'})

db.put('/hello', 'world', function (err) {
  if (err) throw err
  db.get('/hello', function (err, nodes) {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log('/hello --> ' + nodes[0].value)
  })
})
```

## API

#### `var db = hyperdb(storage, [key], [options])`

Create a new hyperdb.

`storage` is a function that is called with every filename hyperdb needs to
operate on. There are many providers for the
[abstract-random-access](https://github.com/juliangruber/abstract-random-access)
interface. e.g.
```js
   var ram = require('random-access-memory')
   var feed = hyperdb(function (filename) {
     // filename will be one of: data, bitfield, tree, signatures, key, secret_key
     // the data file will contain all your data concattenated.

     // just store all files in ram by returning a random-access-memory instance
     return ram()
   })
```

`key` is a `Buffer` containing the local feed's public key. If you do not set
this the public key will be loaded from storage. If no key exists a new key pair
will be generated.

#### `db.on('ready')`

Emitted exactly once: when the db is fully ready and all static properties have
been set. You do not need to wait for this when calling any async functions.

#### `db.on('error', err)`

Emitted if there was a critical error before `db` is ready.

#### `db.version(callback)`

Get the current version identifier as a buffer for the db.

#### `var checkout = db.checkout(version)`

Checkout the db at an older version. The checkout is a DB instance as well.

#### `db.put(key, value, [callback])`

Insert a new value. Will merge any previous values seen for this key.

#### `db.batch(batch, [callback])`

Insert a batch of values efficiently, in a single atomic transaction. A batch should be an array of objects that look like this:

``` js
{
  type: 'put',
  key: someKey,
  value: someValue
}
```

#### `var stream = db.createWriteStream()`

Create a writable stream.

Where `stream.write(data)` accepts data as an object or an array of objects with the same form as `db.batch()`.

#### `db.get(key, callback)`

Lookup a string `key`. Returns a nodes array with the current values for this key.
If there is no current conflicts for this key the array will only contain a single node.

#### `db.local`

Your local writable feed. You have to get an owner of the hyperdb to authorize you to have your
writes replicate. The first person to create the hyperdb is the first owner.

#### `db.authorize(key, [callback])`

Authorize another peer to write to the hyperdb.

To get another peer to authorize you you'd usually do something like

``` js
myDb.on('ready', function () {
  console.log('You local key is ' + myDb.local.key.toString('hex'))
  console.log('Tell an owner to authorize it')
})
```

#### `unwatch = db.watch(folderOrKey, onchange)`

Watch a folder and get notified anytime a key inside this folder
has changed.

``` js
db.watch('/foo/bar', function () {
  console.log('folder has changed')
})

...

db.put('/foo/bar/baz', 'hi') // triggers the above
```

#### `var stream = db.createDiffStream(key[, checkout][, head])`

Find out about changes in key/value pairs between the version `checkout` and
`head` for all keys prefixed by `key`.

`checkout` and `head` are versions to use to compare against. If not provided,
`head` is the current HEAD of the database, and `checkout` is the beginning of
time.

`stream` is a readable object stream that outputs modifications like

```js
{ type: 'del', name: '/a', nodes: [<node>] },
{ type: 'put', name: '/a', nodes: [<node>, <node>] }
{ type: 'put', name: '/b/beep', value: [<node>] }
```

that occured between `checkout` and `head`. When multiple feeds conflict for the
value of a key at a point in time, `nodes` will have multiple entries. `<node>`
is the full hyperdb node.

#### `var stream = db.createHistoryStream([opts, ][start])`

Returns a readable stream of node objects covering all historic values since
either the beginning of time, or the [version](#dbversioncallback) `opts.start`.

Valid opts include:

- `opts.start`: Use this version at the starting point for historic traversal.
- `opts.live`: whether this is a live history stream. If so, the stream will never terminate on its own and will continue emitting nodes in real-time as they are added to the database.

Nodes are emitted in topographic order, meaning if value `v2` was aware of value
`v1` at its insertion time, `v1` must be emitted before `v2`.

#### `var stream = db.replicate([options])`

Create a replication stream. Options include:

``` js
{
  live: false // set to true to keep replicating
}
```
